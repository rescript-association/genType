# master
- TypeScript: type children of imported components as `React.ReactNode`.

# 4.2.0
- Add basic support for inherited type definitions in polymorphic variants e.g. `type color = [red | blue]`. No support for conversion at the moment.

# 4.1.0
- Add support for `external-stdlib` in `bsconfig.json`.
- Fix issue with `exportInterfaces` and labeled arguments (see https://github.com/rescript-association/genType/issues/561). 

# 4.0.0
- Remove support for legacy components.

# 3.50.0
- Flow: use `SyntheticMouseEvent` type for onClick.

# 3.49.0
- Make ReactEvent.Mouse.t be a builtin type corresponding to `MouseEvent`.
- When loading a type defined in another file, treat it as if it were annotated with @genType. So if it's needed for an export from the current file, the annotation is already automatically propagated.
- Use `import type` syntax for TypeScript.

# 3.48.0
- Remove workaround in Flow that turns components into functions when exported.

# 3.46.0
- Add support for different file extensions using the `suffix` configuration from `bsconfig.json`.
- Fix issue where `let x:t = ...` is treated differently in `.res` syntax.

# 3.45.0
- Only support bs-platform `8.2.0` or newer.
- Give a warning when attempting to export a GADT type (unless it's already an opaque export), and export it as an opaque type.
- When not specified in `gentypeconfig`, read the `module` type from `package-specs`.
- Translate object types directly, whether or not they are wrapped in `Js.t`, in preparation for a compiler upgrade. Preserve a couple of existing uses which still map to the empty object: `type t1<'a> = Js.t<'a>`, `type t2 = Js.t<Obj.t>`.
- Use `import` instead of `require` in TS back-end, unless there are circular dependencies. In both TS and Flow, circular dependencies can be avoided by not exporting anything in a file that imports a value/component.
- Support future npm package `rescript` version `9.1.0` and above.
- Add support for the upcoming numeric poly variants (see https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/issues/340).

# 3.44.0
- Fix issue with non-recursive types inside modules when the type name is already in scope (See https://github.com/reason-association/genType/issues/492).
- Support `bs-platform` version `9.0.1` (es6 library modules reverted to `.js` extension)

# 3.43.0
- Add `:` before location in warnings, so the correct line is picked up by vscocde terminal.
- Allow `'` in the name of an exported type without generating invalid JS code.
- Support `bs-platform` version `9.0.0` (es6 library modules now use `.mjs` extension).
- [experimental] Extend experimental option to specify the full extension of generated files (see https://github.com/reason-association/genType/pull/497).

# 3.42.0
- Fix type of references which should be a record type since the runtime representation switched to records.

# 3.41.0
- Internal (Support multiple arguments on the command line for -cmt-rm).

# 3.40.0
- Add support for flexible file names introduced in bs-platform 8.3 (see https://github.com/reason-association/genType/issues/477).

# 3.39.0
- Fix conversion for nested variants from bs-platform 8 onwards.
- Fix name of functions emitted when an inner signature is annotated (see https://github.com/reason-association/genType/issues/474).

# 3.38.0
- Add missing support for annotations in inner module signatures (e.g. `module M : { ... } = { ... }`). See https://github.com/reason-association/genType/issues/469.

# 3.37.0
- Fix issue where a conversion was not applied to optional arguments due to mistaken covariance.

# 3.36.0
- Add support for bs-platform 8.3: abbreviated annotations (e.g. `as` instead of `bs.as`).

# 3.35.0
- Functions `React.ref(-) => React.element` are not considered function components anymore.
- Make `React.ref(-)` types open objects, to align with how they are modeled by Flow.

# 3.34.0
- Add support for `bs.int` and `bs.as` to `@genType.import`.

# 3.33.0
- Add support for `bs.string` and `bs.as` to `@genType.import`.
- Fix issue where `@genType.import` was not supported in interface files.

# 3.32.0
- Fix issue with conversion checking where inner modules without conversion were not exported.
  See https://github.com/reason-association/genType/issues/414.

# 3.31.0
- Fix conversion for ordinary variants without payload (conversion tables were missing).
- Support `@genType.as` for polymorphic variants in bucklescript 8.2.

# 3.30.0
- Fix conversion of ordinary variants with >1 payloads, in bs >= 8.

# 3.29.0
- More support for polymorphic variants in Bucklescript 8.2: no special case for a single payload case, and no renaming via `@genType.as`.

# 3.28.0
- Add missing support for `React.ref` (previously `React.Ref.t`).
- Add ahead-of-time support for the new runtime representatiion of polymorphic variants in the upcoming Bucklescript 8.2.

# 3.27.0
- Add support for `.res[i]` files from the new Bucklescript Syntax. 

# 3.26.0
- Support for bucklescript 8.0.0 (some minor changes wrt bs 8 beta).

# 3.25.0
- Fix issue where `bs.as` in records e.g. `[@bs.as "the-key"] theKey: string,` was not escaped in the generated type.

# 3.23.0
- Add forward support for bucklescript 8.

# 3.22.0
- Only emit inner module when its vaues require no conversion. See https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/pull/416.
- Give a warning when a `@genType` annotations is used with payload.
  E.g. in `[@genType "foo"]` the payload `"foo"` is ignored.

# 3.21.0
- Remove DCE and termination analysis.

# 3.20.0
- Fix issue where genType would not run when the only annotation is in the interface of an inner module.
- Fix issue where an inner module with more values in the implementation than the interface would not generate types annotated in the interface.

# 3.19.0
- Fix issue of missing parens when emitting optional function type.
- In Flow back-end, don't emit config suppression warnings for genType files.

# 3.18.0
- Support new uncurry representation that will be available from Bucklescript version 7.3.0.
- [DCE] Work around the fact that the react.componentt ppx gives `make` a dummy location.
- [DCE] Add option to toggle removing dead values with side effects.
- [DCE] Add whitelist mechanism for function calls with no side effects.

# 3.17.0
- [DCE] Add support for lazyLoad.
- [DCE] Classify dead values that have side effects.
- [DCE] Don't report dead values within the scope of other dead values.
- Add support for int64.

# 3.16.0
- When a `@genType` annotation appears in a `.re`, but the `.rei` also exists, give a warning on the command-line that the annotation will be ignored.
- Dead Code Elimination improvements and bug fixes. Add support for adding annotations to both implementations and interfaces. Analyze recursive functions.

# 3.15.0
- Add support for let%private: nothing is exported even when a `@genType` annotation is added.
- [dce] Add `@dead` annotations to both interface and implementation.
- Add builtin support for `Js.Date.t`.

# 3.14.0
- Extensions of experimental dead code/type analysis. Better annotations for .ml files, bug fixes, report on `let _ = e` when `e` has no side effects.

# 3.13.0
- Support new internal representation of `bs.meth` used in the forthcoming bucklescript 7.2.0.
- Experimental global dead code/type analysis with CLI `-dce` and `-dce-cmt` for bucklescript and native projects respectively.
Environment variables `Whitelist=prefix` and `Blacklist=prefix` can be used to filter which results are reported based on their paths. Use `Write=1` to write `@dead` annotations directly in the source files.

# 3.12.0
- Emit doc commments `/** this is a doc comment */` in the TypeScript output.
- Preserve the parameter names in function types emitted by the TypeScript back-end.
- Treat a function with a single argument of unit type as if it had no arguments.

Example:
```reason
/**
  * Sign a message with a key.
  *
  * @param message - A message to be signed
  * @param key - The key with which to sign the message
  * @returns A signed message
 */
[@genType]
let signMessage = (. message, key) => message ++ string_of_int(key);
```

produces
```ts
/** 
  * Sign a message with a key.
  *
  * @param message - A message to be signed
  * @param key - The key with which to sign the message
  * @returns A signed message
  */
export const signMessage: (message:string, key:number) => string = DocstringsBS.signMessage;
```

# 3.11.0
- Fix issue where a shadowed declaration would be emitted instead of the shadowing one. See https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/354.
- Emit Flow inexact types e.g. `{name:string, ...}`, supported from Flow version 0.84 onwards.
- Emit `eslint-disable` in Untyped back-end.

# 3.10.0
- Fix issues where `@genType.as` on a type definition would omit type parameters.

# 3.9.0
- With TypeScript back-end, emit import of React when function components are exported.
  See https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/342.

# 3.8.0
- Alias `Js.Array2.t` to array type.
- Add support for `[@unboxed]` which will be introduced in the next buclescript version.
  See https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/manual035.html.

# 3.7.0
- Emit in comments the source file from which the .gen file was generated.

# 3.6.0
- Add support for type `result` and `Belt.Result.t`.

# 3.5.0
- Fix issue when emitting optional variants.
  Variants are emitted as `| x | y`, remove the leading `|`.
  Also, Flow uses `?t`, so add parens: `? (foo | bar)`.
- Add builtin support for Js.String2.t as string.
- Add support for `@bs.as` to rename record fields (from bukclescript 7.0.0).
  At that point, use of `@genType.as` on record fields will be discouraged,
  as it incurs the extra cost of runtime conversion.
  But it will be kept for backwards compatibility for existing code.

# 3.4.4
- Add support for bucklescript dependencies, specified in `bs-dependencies`.
  For example, if the dependencies are `"bs-dependencies": ["somelibrary"]` and `somelibrary` contains `Common.re`, this looks up the types of `foo` in the library:
  ```reason
  [@genType]
  let z = Common.foo;
  ```
  Scoped packages of the form e.g. `@demo/somelibrary` are also supported.
  Note: the library must have been published with the `.gen.ts` files created by genType.
  
- With bucklescript 7.x.y, apply conversion when a record field requires renaming.

# 3.3.0
- Fix issue with `[@genType.import "."]` and `[@genType.import ".."]` where the conversion function would be called `.`, which is not a valid name. See https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/296.
- Fix type errors in generated code with TypeScript compilers version 3.7.0 and later.
When importing a type use a local alias: `import type {weekday as $$weekday}` to avoid TypeScript errors about redefining types. See https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/302.
- Fix issue when importing a type with type variables (the variables were omitted).

# 3.2.0
- Prepare support for bucklescript 6.3.x where records will be compiled to objects.
- Add support for `[@bs.meth]`.

# 3.1.0
- Make React.Ref more permissive: `{contents: null | T}`.
- Make `ReactDOMRe.domRef` map to `React.Ref`.

# 3.0.0
- This release is equivalent in functionality to `v2.41.0`, but targets bucklescript versions `6.2.x` (i.e. based on OCaml `4.6).

# 2.41.0
- Fix missing import React in untyped back-end.
- Fix version detection for bucklescript 6.2.x (inner modules).
- Use React.ReactNode for children in TypeScript.

# 2.40.1
- Work around an issue in which bucklescript passes the file names to genType.
  See https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/pull/256.

# 2.40.0
- Export inner modules as objects (when at least one value in the module is exported).
  See: https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/253.

# 2.39.0
- Add new annotation `[@genType.ignoreInterface];`.
  When added at the top `.rei` file, the annotations will be taken from the `.re` file.
  Use case: expose implementation details to JS but not to Reason.

- Always wrap export components in `React.createElement`.
  This fixes an issue when exported components are not functions e.g, because they use `forwardRef`.

# 2.38.0
- Add config option to represent modules as objects at runtime.
  For compatibility with the upcoming bucklescript version 5.2.0.

# 2.37.0
- In TypeScript export children of Reason type `element` as TS type `React.ReactChild`.
  So the exported component can be used from TS with string and number literals.

# 2.36.0
- Export Props type when exporting a function component.
- Add support for exporting references as 1-tuples.
  There are some nuances when the argument type requires conversion: https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/237.

# 2.35.0
- Fix issue where two constants with the same name would be generated in CommonJS mode.

# 2.34.0
- Add support for `[@genType] [@genType.as "SomeName"]` to export renamed values.
- Add more compact form `[@genType "SomeName"]`.

# 2.33.0
- Support import of `[@react.component]` components whose props require conversion.
  The conversion is performed by wrapping the component with a `React.createElement` call,
  so it works whether the component is a function or a class.
  
  All the TypeScript components are now typed with `React.ComponentType<...>`.
  If existing code was using e.g. render props of type `React.FC<...>`,
  direct function calls `foo(props)` should now be replaced with JSX calls `<foo props=... />`.
  
  See https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/pull/226.

- Add configuration option `"fileHeader"` to specify additional text to be emitted in the file header.

# 2.32.0
- Fix issue where conversion functions are not be generated for types defined in other files when `"importPath": "node",` is set in `gentypeconfig`.

# 2.31.1
- Add support for default import when the value is called `default` in the external.
  ```[@genType.import "./MyMath"] external default: int = "default";```
  ```[@genType.import "./MyMath"] external someRenamedName: int = "default";```

# 2.31.0
- Support externals with different name: external foo: someType = "fooRenamed".

# 2.30.0
- TypeScript: represent all function components with type `React.FC<...>`.
  A function component is any value of type `props => React.element` where `props` has type object.  
  Free type variables in type `props` are replaced by `any`.

# 2.29.1
- TypeScript: support importing a functional component declared with type React.FC<...>.

# 2.29.0
- Fix issue where direct type declarations of uncurried types were not recognized.
  Inferred uncurried types or declarations inside other types were working already.
- With untyped back-end, don't add type parameters to generated functions.
- Don't generate conversion for callbacks of type unit => ..., as it's unnecessary from bucklescript 5.
  Before bucklescript version 5, passing a function with arity 0 from JS would give a runtime error,
  so a conversion was used to avoid this, adding runtime cost.

# 2.28.0
- Make core react types builtin instead of requiring a shim file.
- Fix issue with flow back-end when exporting a function component with polymorphic variables.
- Fix issue where exporting a function returning React.element was not considered a function component. (Was checking React.reactElement).

`React.element` and `ReasonReact.reactElement` represented as `React$Node`/`JSX.Element` (Flow/TS).
`React.callback(t1,t2)` represented as `t1 => t2`.
`React.component(t)` represented as `t => React.element`.
`React.Context.t(t)` represented as `React.Context<t>`.
`React.Ref.t(t)` represented as `React.Ref<t>`.
`ReactDOMRe.Ref.currentDomRef` represented as `any`.


# 2.27.0
- In TypeScript, support --noImplicitAny also for indexing objects. (I.e. without --suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors).
- Add support for importing values which are default exports in commonjs.

# 2.26.0
- Give exact Flow type to empty objects.

# 2.25.2
- Add support for importing functions of polymorphic type.

# 2.25.1
- Fix: don't export the state type of components using the old record API.

# 2.25.0
- Fix: extend automatic @genType annotation to type arguments.
- Fix issue when inlining type parameters across different modules.

# 2.24.0
- Don't delete generated files in case of type errors.
- Apply object field mangling convention to named arguments in functions.
  This gives a unified treatment for renaming of object fields, functions, and function components.

# 2.23.0
- Preserve case when importing from a lower-case file name.
- In TypeScript output, disable eslint rule import/first (on by default in newer react-scripts).
- Generate explicit return type for the function that type checks an imported (record) component.

# 2.22.0
- Support import of function components.
- Fix issue where only shallow conversion was generated for nested records defined in another file.
- Opaque types are now generated only for type definitions annotated with [@genType.opaque].
  Unknown types now are left unchanged, so type errors will indicate that shims need to be added.
- Show file name in react developer tools when importing function components.

# 2.21.1
- Fix parentheses in function components with Flow back-end.

# 2.21.0
- Make Flow type check function components.
- Add experimental support for prop types. Add `"propTypes": true` and `"language": "untyped"` to the configuration.

# 2.20.0
- Add support for default export like in bucklescript: call the value "default".
- Hooks: generate names analogous to those from ppx for the React developer tools.
- Apply bucklescript's marshaling rules for Js object field names:
  Remove trailing `__` if present.
  Otherwise remove leading `_` when followed by an uppercase letter, or keyword.


# 2.19.0
- Add first-class support for Js.Promise.t, and conversion when required.
- Emit the variant conversion tables in a stable order to limit changes when the source is modified.

# 2.18.0
- Fix: enable conversion for types defined inside a module in another file.
- Fix conversion for types involving multiple type definitions in another file.
- Add support for module aliases such as module X = A.B.
  Extra type definitions are added so that all the aliases of @genType-annotated
  type declarations are also exported.
  In case of local aliases to types from other files, these are always inlined.

# 2.17.0
- Add support for bucklescript version 5 (AST for bs.module has changed).
- Support file names starting with lower case letter.

If using bucklescript >= 5.0.0:

- It is not necessary anymore to set up `BS_CMT_POST_PROCESS_CMD`.
- The line `[@bs.module "./ThisFileName.gen"]` in value imports can be omitted, and will be added internally by bucklescript.

# 2.16.0
- Avoid underscore when emitting conversion function for wrapJsForReason.
- Support inner modules with shadowed values.
- Fix: support transitive reachability of type definitions of arbitrary length.
  Before this, only paths of level 2 were available to generate conversion functions.
  E.g. this was not supported: A uses a type defined in B which uses a type defined in C.

# 2.15.0
- Omit underscore as function name when emitting conversions.

# 2.14.0
- Import Curry early, so it's available if needed for an import conversion.
- Automatically export types referenced by an imported value.
- Import CreateBuckescriptBlock early, so it's available if needed for an import conversion.

# 2.13.0
- Fix missing cases (records and variants): Don't import referenced types with genType.opaque.
- In flow, annotate function parameters with type any, just as for TypeScript.
  This helps typing conversion functions with nested null checks.

# 2.12.2
- Fix issue where importing a type which has no definition from other files could reset the type enironment.
  Resetting the type environment causes failures depending on the order of type arguments in https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/158.

# 2.12.1
- Emit type parametes when generating polymorphic conversion functions.

# 2.12.0
- Support type definitions in first-class module types.
- Handle correctly first-class module types with nested modules inside.
- Add support for first-class module types with type equations.

- Fix signature of ImmutableArray length and size.

# 2.10.0
- Fix: convert first-class module types when defined in other files.

# 2.5.1
- Add support for pairs in @genType.import to encode rename information.
Instead of writing

```reason
[@genType.import "./js/MyBanner"]
[@genType.as "TopLevelClass.MiddleLevelElements.MyBannerInternal"]
```

This can be used instead:
```reason
[@genType.import ("./js/MyBanner", "TopLevelClass.MiddleLevelElements.MyBannerInternal")]
```

# 2.4.1
- Fix issue with namespace mode: conversion was not performed for types defined in other files, as the correct .cmt files was not found.

# 2.4.0
- Restore support for namespaces, and make commonjs-react-example a namespace example.
- Add support for genType.as for the type name, to record type declarations.

# 2.3.1
- Fix issue where conversion functions for types defined in other files would be missing if the first declararation in that other file is not annotated with @genType.

- Flow mode: add eslint-disable.
- Fix missing conversion of optional arguments of components.

# 2.2.2
- Fix issue where default function arguments of some type requiring conversion were not checked for undefined.
- Add missing support for @genType.opaque in variants.

# 2.2.0
- Indent function definitions and if-then-else's.
- Indent variant declarations.
- Spacing after/before brackets in object types.
- In TypeScript, use the preferred semicolon in object types.

# 2.1.0
- In commonjs, import components simply as a `require` without ".default".

# 2.0.0
- New unified support for polymorphic variants and ordinary variants. If possible (at most one case with payload of object type), use an unboxed representation. Otherwise use `{tag: label, value: ...}`.
- This is a **Breaking Change**: ordinary variants used to be represented as opaque types with construction functions. Now, ordinary variants have the same representation as polymorphic variants.

# 1.9.0
- [Enums: support one object type, plus strings/booleans/integers](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/pull/118).

# 1.7.0
- Add support for paths in `@genType.as` when importing components from JS. Also, simply support renaming.

- Fix missing import React when importing component in untyped back-end.

# 1.6.0
- [Fix issue with access to the .bs.js file when exporting nested component](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/104).
- Fix: [Emit enum conversion tables early, to avoid the case where they’re used before being defined](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/102).
- Add support for exporting uncurried function types.

# 1.5.0
- Hygiene: avoid variable capture for generated variable names (function arguments, return value, array items).

# 1.4.0
- Adapt bs-platform lib import path depending on the module kind specified in config.
- Add -clean command to delete all the generated files.
- Fix: translation of variant types should be the identity.
- Avoid accidental variable name capture when generating constructors functions for variants.
- TypeScript: avoid type errors when converting function types by giving arguments type `any`.

# 1.3.0
- Auto propagate annotations to and from variant type declarations (not just normal type declarations).
- Auto propagate annotations to types mentioned in exported values and components.

# 1.2.1
- Fix importing type via renaming. Need to export both the original and renamed type.

# 1.2.0.
- Translate empty object types as `{}`. This avoids pulling it a shim for `Js.t`.
- Support renaming via `[@genType.as "name"]` when exporting types.

# 1.1.0
- Emit `import` instead of `require` with ES6 modules in Flow/Untyped back-end, except when import cycles are possible (Reason importing JS values/components). [PR](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/pull/92).
- Add support for `@genType.as` when importing values from JS. This supports renaming, importing default values, and importing nested values via a path.

# 1.0.0
- Don’t import type dependencies for opaque types.
- Add `bsconfig.json` option "generatedFileExtension" to configure the extension used for generated files.
- Change the extension of generated files to `.gen.tsx` (TS) and `.gen.js` (Flow/Untyped). [#90](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/pull/90)

# 0.26.0
- Support importing types with type parameters.
- Prevent imported values from being used directly from JS.

# 0.25.0
- Remove deprecated CLI option `—setProjectRoot`.
- Support `@genType.as "name"` to rename how labeled arguments in functions are exported. Works for function definitions and function types declarations. In parcticular, the `make` function for components. In case of function definitions, the first argument can't be renamed because of a compiler bug. [See this issue](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/75).

# 0.24.0
- Improved debug output and number of options, and made controllable from bsconfig.json.
- Fixed issue with import strings containig `.\directory` on Windows.
- Extended support for signatures and module types.
- Module include is supported for Type Expansion.
- First-orer modules are supported for Type Expansion.
- Functor application supported for Type Expansion.
- Annotating a type means all the types mentioned in it are also considered annotated. (Implemented via Type Expansion).
- Add support for type expansion [See this issue](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType/issues/70)

# 0.23.0

- In Flow, keep opaque types also opaque internally, so export erros are caught early like in TS.
- Fix: Type names for types which are defined somewhere are not considered opaque.
- Fix: no conversion generated for opaque types.
- Generated code can be in a different order, because of refactoring how type declarations are processed.

# 0.22.0
