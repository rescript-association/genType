name: Build npm release

# Tag triggering:
# We build any tags starting prefixed with a `v`, based
# on the way npm tags version releases (e.g. v3.0.0)
#
# v2.* tags should only be recognized by our old CI systems
# (from branch 4_02), so we ignore everything starting with `v2.*`.
#
# Branch triggering:
# We configured only a set of static branches, which will be automatically
# built with every commit (even without PR).
#
# Branches with an open PR will automatically be built as well, so we don't
# have to list them here (otherwise we will have two CI builds every time)
